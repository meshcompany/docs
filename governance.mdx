### Quorum and Approval

<Accordion title="Quorum Requirements">
**Standard Proposals**: 15% of circulating supply must participate

### Vote Delegation

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
# Delegate voting power
from meshai.governance import GovernanceClient

gov_client = GovernanceClient(wallet_private_key)

# Delegate all voting power to another address
delegation_tx = await gov_client.delegate_votes(
    delegate_address="delegate_wallet_address",
    percentage=100  # Delegate 100% of voting power
)

# Partial delegation
partial_delegation = await gov_client.delegate_votes(
    delegate_address="delegate_wallet_address", 
    percentage=75  # Keep 25% for personal voting
)

# Remove delegation
remove_delegation = await gov_client.revoke_delegation()
```

```javascript JavaScript
// Delegate voting power
import { GovernanceClient } from 'meshai-sdk';

const govClient = new GovernanceClient({ privateKey: walletPrivateKey });

// Delegate all voting power
const delegationTx = await govClient.delegateVotes({
  delegateAddress: 'delegate_wallet_address',
  percentage: 100
});

// Partial delegation  
const partialDelegation = await govClient.delegateVotes({
  delegateAddress: 'delegate_wallet_address',
  percentage: 75
